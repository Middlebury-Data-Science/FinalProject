* Name: Carter Merenstein
* Project title: Lyme Disease and the Tick Microbiome
* Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector borne disease in the United States, with over 30,000 cases reported each year. It is caused by the bacteria *Borrelia burgdorferi*, which is carried by ticks and infects humans after a tick bite. In this project I looked at the bacterial microbiome of 92 ticks in order to try to identify bacteria that might reduce *Borrelia* prevalence. In the process I did an exploratory data analysis and identified differences in the microbiomes of ticks by sex and location. I was unable to identify any bacteria that were significantly negatively correlated with *Borrelia* prevalence, though I did find that bacteria in the family *Oxalobacteraceae* were positively correlated with *Borrelia* abundance.

Below are stacked bar graphs which represent the microbiomes from all 92 ticks. Colors represent different types of bacteria, and each virtical bar is a tick. This is an easy graphical way to begin to understand differences in tick microbiomes.
