* Name: Phil Hoxie 
* Project title: How to Row the Head of the Charles
* Abstract:

This paper seeks to understand the Head of the Charles primarily as it pertains to collegiate rowing. This paper evaluates the relative competitiveness of each event at the Head of the Charles and takes a detailed look at how the 4s and 8s rowed the course and how the course itself effected the outcome of the race. Overall, it appears that boats that started fastest out of the gate did better even though they dropped in the distribution later in the race.
