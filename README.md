# Project Details

* Name: Jacob Dixon 
* Project title: Children's Safe Product Act: Making an Accessible Shiny App
* Abstract:This project explored the available data from the Children's Safe Product Act of Washington State. Through an exploration of the data, figures of interest are presented as well as a discussion of chemical compounds of interest and the repercussions of having those compounds in children's toys. A Shiny App was created to make this data more accessible to the average user.



###Data and Discussion 
*Exploration of the difficulties of navigating the large Children's Safe Product Act (CSPA) dataset

*Discussion of impications of limited data



###Shiny App
*Allows users to choose product of interest that results in graph of companies with submissions matching that product description. 

*Based on product selection, list of companies is populated and user can select a specfic company. This results in two figures; one showing the chemical compounds present, and one showing the purpose of those compounds. 

*Makes navigating the 38,000+ submission dataset much simpler and faster.
