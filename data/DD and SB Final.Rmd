#Abstract:

  The present analysis explores the comparative distributions of Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks in eastern Massachusetts. These two franchises are both highly successful coffeehouse chains despite a competitive market with low profit margins. Massachusetts was selected as the location of interested because it is my home state, and I know from experience there are strong loyalties by different groups of people to both Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks. Mapping both franchises revealed that there are many more Dunkin’ Donuts than Starbucks locations in eastern Massachusetts, and their densities differ by city vs. suburbs as well as by county. Additionally, the franchise density of Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts in a census tract are moderately associated with income. Overall, the present investigation reveals that Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks distributions differ both geographically, but also economically.


#Introduction:

  Global coffee consumption as well as the U.S. coffeehouse industry have been steadily on the rise in since 2009 (ICO; IBISWorld). In the United States, the two leading coffeehouse chains are Starbucks Corporation and Dunkin’ Brands Inc., which collectively comprised over 60% of the coffeehouse market in 2014 (CIEEDAC). Despite sharing a competitive market with relatively low profit margins, the two chains have steadily expanded their number of locations over the past ten years (Starbucks, "Number of Starbucks…”; Dunkin’ Donuts, “Number of Dunkin’…”).  
  
  The two chains are distinct from each other, however, in several regards. For one, Starbucks is a much larger, international corporation, and the second most valuable fast food brand worldwide behind McDonalds (Brown), bringing in over $19 billion in revenue in 2015 (Starbucks, "Revenue of Starbucks…”), whereas Dunkin’ Donuts, exclusively domestic, made just over $800 million in 2015 (Dunkin' Donuts, "Revenue of Dunkin').   
  
  Additionally, the two chains have very distinct company philosophies. Dunkin’ Donuts was founded in 1950 in Quincy, MA by William Rosenberg. He started with a canteen truck, selling refreshments to workers at factories and construction sites. He saw that his most lucrative items were coffee and donuts and so decided to open a permenant location selling these items (“William Rosenberg”). The Dunkin' Donuts mission is to “make and serve the freshest, most delicious coffee and donuts quickly and courteously in modern, well-merchandised stores” (Dunkin Donuts, “Dunkin’ Donuts”). Its website emphasizes speed of service and customer loyalty.
  
  Starbucks, founded in Seattle, WA in 1971, was born out of the desire to create a coffeehouse with the same feel as traditional Italian coffee bars. CEO, Howard Schultz, wanted to create “a place for conversation and a sense of community, a third place between work and home” (Starbucks, "Company Information”). The Starbucks website emphasizes both the premium quality of its products, but also heavily underscores this community aspect, which Dunkin’ Donuts does not mention at all. The company mission is “to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time” and they strive to “make sure everything [they] do is through the lens of humanity – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly” (Starbucks, "Company Information”).   
  
  This community experience comes at a price, however. A preliminary price analysis of both franchises shows that for comparable items, Starbucks is reliably more expensive. One notable exception is for their breakfast sandwiches, where Dunkin’ Donuts’ is more expensive, though the difference is very small. All price estimates came from fastfoodmenuprices.com and are estimates only.

These observations about company differences led to two main hypotheses.
 * Because of its in-state roots, there are more Dunkin’ Donuts in this region than Starbucks. 
 * The two franchises market to different clientele, both spatially and economically.  

#Methods:

##Area of Interest
This investigation explores the distribution of both franchises in the six counties comprising and surrounding Boston: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Bristol, and Plymouth. 

##Data
Income and demographic data for this region was obtained from [Social Explorer](http://old.socialexplorer.com/pub/reportdata/HtmlResults.aspx?reportid=R11178485), and the MA shapefile was loaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2015-state-massachusetts-current-census-tract-state-based-shapefile).

##Franchise Locations
 The franchise location data was scraped from Google. The Google Places API allows for radar searches that take a latitude, longitude, and radius, and return all the results of a search query (in this case, Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts) within that radius. I adapted code from a previous student ([wjones127](https://github.com/wjones127/franchise-densities)) and covered the area of interest in radar searches. See the plot below. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#code from other student to search centers:
makeCircle <- function(LonDec, LatDec, Km, group) {#Corrected function
  #LatDec = latitude in decimal degrees of the center of the circle
  #LonDec = longitude in decimal degrees
  #Km = radius of the circle in kilometers
  ER <- 6371 #Mean Earth radius in kilometers. Change this to 3959 and you will have your function working in miles.
  AngDeg <- seq(1:360) #angles in degrees
  Lat1Rad <- LatDec*(pi/180)#Latitude of the center of the circle in radians
  Lon1Rad <- LonDec*(pi/180)#Longitude of the center of the circle in radians
  AngRad <- AngDeg*(pi/180)#angles in radians
  Lat2Rad <-asin(sin(Lat1Rad)*cos(Km/ER)+cos(Lat1Rad)*sin(Km/ER)*cos(AngRad)) #Latitude of each point of the circle rearding to angle in radians
  Lon2Rad <- Lon1Rad+atan2(sin(AngRad)*sin(Km/ER)*cos(Lat1Rad),cos(Km/ER)-sin(Lat1Rad)*sin(Lat2Rad))#Longitude of each point of the circle rearding to angle in radians
  Lat2Deg <- Lat2Rad*(180/pi)#Latitude of each point of the circle rearding to angle in degrees (conversion of radians to degrees deg = rad*(180/pi) )
  Lon2Deg <- Lon2Rad*(180/pi)#Longitude of each point of the circle rearding to angle in degrees (conversion of radians to degrees deg = rad*(180/pi) )
  # output dataframe of locations
  return(data_frame(long = Lon2Deg, lat = Lat2Deg, group = group))
}

#Basically using trial and error, I selected the latitude and longitude of centers of radar searches that would cover my whole region
search.centers <- data_frame(
  long = c(seq(-71.11, -70.7, length.out = 3),
           seq(-71.7, -70.6, length.out= 6),
           seq(-71.43, -70.73, length.out = 4),

         sb_1000 = ifelse(sb_1000 == Inf, NA, sb_1000),
         sb_1000 = ifelse(total_population < 1000, NA, sb_1000),
         dd_1000 = numDD * 1000 / total_population,
         dd_1000 = ifelse(dd_1000 == Inf, NA, dd_1000),
         dd_1000 = ifelse(total_population < 1000, NA, dd_1000))


#Plot DD and SB locations!
MAmap +
  geom_point(data = ddloc,
             aes(x = long, y = lat),
             color = 'orange',
             size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(data = sbloc,

```

As is evident in both the map and the above tables, there are almost fourfold the number of Dunkin' Donuts as Starbucks locations in eastern MA. 

#Spatial Distribution Analysis

In order to test the hypothesis that the two franchises cater to different populations, and thus have different distribution patterns, it is useful to graph the densities of one against the other. A positive trend would indicate that both franchises pick locations in the same areas, while a negative trend would indicate that their distributions do not overlap. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
MAincomedata2 <- MAincomedata2 %>% 
  mutate(SB_Density = sb_1000, 
         DD_Density = dd_1000)

scatterplot <- ggplot(MAincomedata2, aes(x = DD_Density, y = SB_Density, color = County)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(text = paste(Geo_NAME,  "<br>",
                                 "Population:", total_population, "<br>",
                                 "Median Income:", med_inc))) +
  xlab("Dunkin' Donuts per 1000 people") +
  ylab("Starbucks per 1000 people") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts Distributions")
ggplotly(scatterplot)

```

There is a net positive trend here, which makes sense; in areas with more development, we would expect more of both franchises. 
To examine the differences between the two distributions, we need to look at the data more closely. The first variable I looked at was city vs. subarbs, where Suffolk County was classified as Boston, proper, and all of the other counties were considered suburbs. When the data is split like this, an interesting trend emerges. The following graph shows the franchise densities of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts in the city vs. the subarbs.  

```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
city_descript <- MAincomedata2 %>% 
  mutate(cityproper = ifelse(County == "Suffolk", 1, 0)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dd_1000), !is.na(sb_1000)) %>% 
  group_by(cityproper) %>% 
  summarise(ddrate = mean(dd_1000),
            ddsd = round(sd(dd_1000), 3), 
            sbrate = mean(sb_1000),
            sbsd = round(sd(sb_1000), 3)) 

city_descript2 <- gather(city_descript, "Franchise", "Density", ends_with("rate")) %>% 
  mutate(Region = ifelse(cityproper == 0, "Suburbs", "Boston"), 
         Franchise = ifelse(Franchise == "ddrate", "Dunkin_Donuts", "Starbucks")) %>% 
  mutate(stdev = ifelse(Franchise == "Dunkin_Donuts", ddsd, sbsd)) %>% 
  select(-sbsd, -ddsd)

densities <- ggplot(city_descript2, aes(x = Region, y = Density, fill = Franchise)) +
  geom_bar(aes(text = paste("Standard Deviation", stdev)), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#e6550d", "#006d2c")) +
  ylab("Franchises per 1000 people") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ggtitle("City vs. Suburb Franchise Density")
ggplotly(densities)
```

It is evident that the absolute number of Dunkin' Donuts in both the city and the subarbs is higher than that of Starbucks. However. Interestingly, there are more Dunkin' Donuts per 1000 people in the suburbs than the city, while there are fewer Starbucks per 1000 people in the subarbs than the city. 
The following ANOVA output shows that there is, in fact, a statistically significant interaction effect between Franchise and region (city vs. suburbs). F = 4.462, p = 0.0348.
```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
city_descript1 <- MAincomedata2 %>%  
  mutate(cityproper = ifelse(County == "Suffolk", 1, 0)) %>% 
  select(Geo_FIPS, dd_1000, sb_1000, cityproper) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dd_1000), !is.na(sb_1000))
city_descript1 <- gather(city_descript1, "Franchise", "Density", ends_with("1000")) %>% 
  mutate(Franchise = ifelse(Franchise == "dd_1000", 
                            "Dunkin_Donuts", "Starbucks"))

Fran_reg <- aov(city_descript1$Density ~ city_descript1$Franchise*city_descript1$cityproper)
summary(Fran_reg)
```


The following plot encapsulates this phenomenon. Deviations from the line y = 0 represent relative differences in the franchise densities in the suburbs relative to Boston.

```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
percentchange <- city_descript %>% 
  summarise(Dunkin_Donuts = (first(ddrate) - last(ddrate))/first(ddrate), 
            Starbucks = (first(sbrate) - last(sbrate))/first(sbrate)) %>% 
  gather("Franchise", "Percent_Change", c(Dunkin_Donuts, Starbucks)) %>% 
  mutate(Percent_Change = Percent_Change*100)


ggplot(percentchange, aes(x = Franchise, y = Percent_Change, fill = Franchise)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#e6550d", "#006d2c")) +
  ylab("Percent Difference") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  ggtitle("Percent Difference in Franchise Density in Boston vs. the Suburbs")

city_descript2 <- city_descript2[, c(2, 4, 3, 5)]

knitr::kable(city_descript2)
knitr::kable(percentchange)

```

I wanted to make this using plotly (instead of the ancillary tables), but there is a documented bug where plotly renders negative ggplot bar graphs positive, which takes away the main message of the graph.

###Distributions by County

The distribution of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts can be further explored by breaking up the "Suburbs" category. The below plot shows the densities of Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks by county. Again, we see that the densities of one franchise does not predict the other. In fact, there almost appears to be an inverse trend. 
Additionally, average median income for each county is displayed as a point (scaled down by a factor 10^-6). 
```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
region <- MAincomedata2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dd_1000), !is.na(sb_1000)) %>% 
  group_by(County) %>% 
  summarise(DD = mean(dd_1000),
            SB = mean(sb_1000))


region2 <- region %>%  gather("Franchise", "Density", 2:3) 

region3 <- region2 %>% 
  mutate(level = ifelse(County == "Bristol", 1, 
                  ifelse(County == "Essex", 4,
                  ifelse(County == "Middlesex", 5,
                  ifelse(County == "Norfolk", 3,
                  ifelse(County == "Plymouth", 2,
                  ifelse(County == "Suffolk", 6, NA)))))))

incomes2 <- incomes %>% 
  mutate(scaled_income = Avg_Median_Income/1000000) %>% 
  mutate(Avg_Median_Income = signif(Avg_Median_Income, 3))

countybreakdown <- ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data = region3, aes(x = (reorder(County, level)), y = Density, 
                        fill = Franchise), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#e6550d", "#006d2c", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Franchise Densities by County") +
  ylab("Franchises per 1000 people") +
  xlab("County") +
  geom_point(data = incomes2, aes(x = County, y = scaled_income, 
            text = paste("Average Median Income:", Avg_Median_Income)), 
            show.legend = TRUE, color = "#636363", size = 3)
ggplotly(countybreakdown)

```

A two-way between-groups ANOVA showed that the interaction between franchise and county is statiscally significant. F = 5.574, p 0.0000416. See the output below. 
```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
county_data <- MAincomedata2 %>% 
  select(Geo_FIPS, dd_1000, sb_1000, County) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dd_1000), !is.na(sb_1000))
county_data <- gather(county_data, "Franchise", "Density", ends_with("1000")) %>% 
  mutate(Franchise = ifelse(Franchise == "dd_1000", 
                            "Dunkin_Donuts", "Starbucks"))

county_franchise <- aov(county_data$Density ~ county_data$Franchise*county_data$County)
summary(county_franchise)
```




#Economic Distribution Analysis

The next question I looked into was whether the franchise distributions were at all related to income in those areas.

In order to test this, I performed linear regressions using median income as the predictor variable of Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks densities on the census tract level. The tables below show the resulting coefficients of the regressions, as well as visualizations. 

###Dunkin Donuts

```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inc_data <- MAincomedata2 %>% 
  select(Geo_FIPS, dd_1000, sb_1000, med_inc) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dd_1000), !is.na(sb_1000))
inc_data <- gather(inc_data, "Franchise", "Density", ends_with("1000")) %>% 
  mutate(Franchise = ifelse(Franchise == "dd_1000", 
                            "Dunkin_Donuts", "Starbucks"))

dd_data2 <- filter(inc_data, Franchise == "Dunkin_Donuts")
dd_inc <- lm(Density ~ med_inc, data = dd_data2)
ddinccoefs <-coefficients(dd_inc)

sb_data2 <- filter(inc_data, Franchise == "Starbucks")
sb_inc <- lm(Density ~ med_inc, data = sb_data2)
sbinccoefs <- coefficients(sb_inc)

knitr::kable(summary(dd_inc)$coef)
```


###Starbucks
```{r, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(sb_inc)$coef) 

ggplot(dd_data2, aes(x = med_inc, y = Density)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = ddinccoefs[2], intercept = ddinccoefs[1], col = "darkorange", size =1.5) +
  xlab("Median Income") +
  ylab("Franchise Density")+
  ggtitle("Dunkin' Donuts Density by Median Income")

ggplot(sb_data2, aes(x = med_inc, y = Density)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = sbinccoefs[2], intercept = sbinccoefs[1], col = "darkgreen", size = 1.5) +
  xlab("Median Income") +
  ylab("Franchise Density")+
  ggtitle("Starbucks Density by Median Income")

```

A linear regression revealed that median income did significantly predict Starbucks densities, such that census tracts with higher median incomes had more Starbucks. This was subtle (a very small slope), but nonetheless significant (p = 0.0017). For Dunkin' Donuts, the relationship was only marginally significant (p = 0.0660), and equally subtle, but, interestingly, of opposite magnitude! In census tracts with higher median incomes, there were actually fewer Dunkin' Donuts.

#Conclusion
Overall, Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts do have different distributions and appear to cater to different clientele, both spatially and economically. Starbucks are more densely distributed in cities and located in areas with higher median incomes. Dunkin' Donuts are more densely distributed in the suburbs, and located in areas with lower median incomes.

It is important to note, however, that this analysis only applied to the counties comprising and surrounding Boston. It would be interesting to explore whether the same trends apply throughout the state. An analysis of major coffeehouse franchises on a national scale would also be very interesting. Dunkin' Donuts is not uniformly spread throughout the country; rather it clusters in the northeast. The main coffee-chain competitors of Starbucks in other regions, must be different.
